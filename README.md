# Project for the robotic practicum course

The goal of the project was to create a robot arm which can move three coloured cubes from one place to another in a desired order. Also, we needed to create a GUI for the robot.

The project was done in teams of three students. I mostly focused on creating the computer vision and inverse kinematics part of the project. 

The project was programmed in Matlab. We are satisfied with the project result.
